# Accuracy = (Corrected prediction/Total Prediction) * 100
# Precision = (True Positives/Total Predictive positive)
# Recall = (True Positives/Total actual Positives)


# precentage = out of 100 - how much happend
# ration -comparison 
# a:b or 1:2

# p = (part/whole) * 100
# ratio = part/whole

total = 100
correct = 90
wrong = 10

# Accuracy = (90/100) * 100 = 90%
